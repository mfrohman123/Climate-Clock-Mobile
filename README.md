# Climate-Clock-Mobile
A iOS mobile adaptation of https://climateclock.world

Built using a WKWebView wrapper from somewhere I can't find the link to anymore. The app was submitted to the iOS App Store several times, but it was rejected each one for "minimum functionality." Iterated through new features several times to overcome this, but to no avail. The Climate Clock team decided to go in a different direction anyways, so here is the app.

The app includes a mobile view of the original Climate Clock website, as well as a custom built guide to create your very own Climate Clock and share it on social media.

Please use and change this to your hearts content, but on one condition: please think about and try to help us fix our environment and resolve climate change before it's too late.
